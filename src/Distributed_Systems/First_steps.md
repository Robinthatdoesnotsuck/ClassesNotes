# Distributed Systems

Hi fellow student, this is the chapter regarding the full distributed systems course at Universidad Panamericana.
The chapter is divided into sections that are each divided by chapters that you can read along your course work at class.

The book its arranged in a linear way, so if you get behind some topics or have certain questions about them you can revisit
the previous chapters to study or ask the teacher.

Some of the code examples in the first chapters are programmed/written to work standalone with the book so you can execute
those examples without much fear, reminded that the more advanced course work will have code examples of a much larger component
so you'll have to work along the repository provided at class to see the examples running.
