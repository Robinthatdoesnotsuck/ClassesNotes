# Creating a project for microservices

We usually just create a project with whatever language we want to use and well that is it right? Well NO we don't really do that.

We need to stablish first a plan on how we will build our app not on the functional side only, but on how we structure code and how this will help us stablish good practices as a whole.

For this project I will follow the repository pattern -> this will be mostly used as a learning tool as it will helps us understand better how to code microservices and how to structure a project.
