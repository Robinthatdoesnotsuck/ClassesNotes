# HTML not a programming language

ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT HTML IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

## What is, how and when with HTML

HTML stand for hyper-text-markup-language as we explained before html is the language that defines how we see the web or web pages:

- It structures web-pages
- It consists on different elements with different type of relationships
- These elements are called tags and each different tag determines how an element will be rendered on the browser

So lets look at an example of a super simple web page

```html,editable
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>some page title</title>
      </head>
      <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

      </body>
    </html> 
  ```

An html has a simple initial structure:

1. We have the ``<!DOCTYPE>`` declarion, this determines the document type and version (there has been a lot of html version through out the years)
2. Next we have the ``<html>`` tag, this is actually the beginning of our html structure.
3. Next we have the ``<head>`` tag, here we declared the metadata for our page, that would be scripts, style sheets, our page title, etc.
4. Finally we have the ``<body>`` tag, this is the actual content that we will see on the browser when openning a page.

In html we have different tags to describe the content we want, the tags that we want rendered on the web page goes inside the ``<body>`` tag.
We can add paragraphs, headings, images, forms, text boxes, buttons, links, videos, etc. Whatever it has been added to the HTML 5 version standard.
