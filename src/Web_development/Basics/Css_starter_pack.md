CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets:

- It let developers to add some needed style and color to the web
- It is a simple yet super powerful and complex tool
- The most complex topic in web page design is CSS so buckle up

## Basic CSS structure

Css needs something we call selector:

- A selector is the element you want to stlye
- Then we need a declaration with a property and the value we want to change from that property and it goes something like this

```css
body {
        background: plum;
        color: black;
    }
```

In this case we want to modify the body element and we want the background color to be plum color and that stand alone property called color modifies the text color of the element
and we change that to black.
