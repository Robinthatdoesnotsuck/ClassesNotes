# First part of three

The basic structure of a web page is divided in three essentials parts, base HTML, styling with css and programming with javascript.
Anything else after this, been libraries or specific programming languages to manage this elements (like php, or typescript) just manipulates these three components in some way.

So knowing these three basic elements is essential to learn how to develop web apps:

- HTML stands for hypertext markup language
  - This controls how content is arranged in a web page, manages the whole structure of the web page with elements in a tree like structure
- CSS stands for cascading style sheets
- Javascript(god forsaken thing) is the scripting language of the web
