# React a frontend library

ReactJs is a library developed by Facebook for rendering UI with a little bit more re-usability, cause react lets us encapsulate component definitions as building blocks of a website. It empowers the way we build simple HTML into a more advanced and friendly way to handle the layout and instead of just adding individual html elements we use react components that behave according to well whatever we fill like it, it is kinda hard to explain with just words so we will be taking a look into ReactJs to get a hands-on experience.
